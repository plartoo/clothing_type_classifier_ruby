An experiment on implementating a simple word-frequency-based, and Naive-Bayes-based classifiers written in Ruby.
For further (but brief) explanations and results, please read "Explanations_and_results".

Note: you should have "rake", "rubygems" and a few others ruby stuff required in "lib/dependencies.rb" installed.

Type:

$ rake -T
to get available rake tasks options.

$ rake -D <rake task name>

for detailed instruction of how to use a particular rake task.

Have fun!

p.s. No guarantee is made on anything related to this code so please use it with your wisdom ( I trust you! ;) ).
